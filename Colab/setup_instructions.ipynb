    "This code block is used to set up a specific version of Python (3.8) in the current Google Colab environment using Miniconda, a smaller version of Anaconda that includes only conda and its dependencies. After setting up the environment, it also prints out the current Python version and installs a specific version of protobuf (3.20.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of what each line does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `!wget -O mini.sh https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_4.8.2-Linux-x86_64.sh`: This line downloads the Miniconda installation script for Python 3.8 from the official Anaconda repository and saves it as `mini.sh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `!chmod +x mini.sh`: This line changes the permissions of the `mini.sh` file to make it executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `!bash ./mini.sh -b -f -p /usr/local`: This line runs the `mini.sh` script to install Miniconda. The `-b` option tells the script to run in batch mode, which prevents it from prompting for user input. The `-f` option tells the script to force installation even if there are existing files. The `-p /usr/local` option specifies the installation location.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `!conda install -q -y jupyter`: This line uses conda to install Jupyter. The `-q` option tells conda to run in quiet mode, which reduces the amount of output. The `-y` option tells conda to assume \"yes\" for all prompts, which allows the installation to proceed without user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `!conda install -q -y google-colab -c conda-forge`: This line uses conda to install the `google-colab` package from the `conda-forge` channel. The `google-colab` package is necessary to run Colab notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `!python -m ipykernel install --name \"py38\" --user`: This line installs a new IPython kernel named \"py38\" for the installed Python 3.8. This allows Jupyter to use Python 3.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `import sys` and `print(f\"Current Python Version: {sys.version}\")`: These lines print out the current Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `!pip install -q protobuf==3.20.3`: This line installs a specific version of protobuf (3.20.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**After running this code**, you should **restart the runtime and change the runtime type to use the newly installed Python 3.8**. You can **do this by going to Runtime > Change runtime type and selecting \"py38\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this method of changing the Python version in Google Colab is a workaround and may lead to unexpected issues. It's generally recommended to write your code in a way that it can run on the default Python version provided by Google Colab (currently Python 3.7).\n",
