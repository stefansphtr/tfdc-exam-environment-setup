## Google Colab

Google Colab is a free cloud service that provides GPU resources for machine learning education and research. It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.

For detailed setup instructions, see [Google Colab Setup](./Colab/setup_instructions.ipynb).

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (including C++, C#, Python, etc.) and runtimes.

For detailed setup instructions, see [Visual Studio Code Setup](./VSCode/setup_instructions.md).

## PyCharm

PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, and supports web development with Django.

For detailed setup instructions, see [PyCharm Setup](./PyCharm/setup_instructions.md).
